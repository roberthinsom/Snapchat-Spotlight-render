        <h2>What is Snapchat Spotlight?</h2>
        <p>Snapchat Spotlight is a feature that was introduced by Snapchat in late 2020 as part of the app's initiative to compete with platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. It allows users to create and share short video content—up to 60 seconds in length—that is curated and featured in a dedicated Spotlight feed. This content is easily discoverable by other users, providing creators a chance to go viral and reach a much larger audience than they would with regular snaps.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional snaps, which are sent directly to friends or posted to stories, Spotlight videos are visible to everyone using Snapchat. The feature aims to highlight user creativity and provide a platform where anyone can be discovered based on their content's popularity rather than their follower count.</p>
